    Instructions:
    - If the user doesn't mention the degree in its question that you are answering then the degree columns doesn't exist
    - Use 'LIKE' instead of '=' in WHERE statements, and '%' before and after the search string.
    - For SMC-related queries, look for "Saint Mary's College of California".
    - When querying for job titles, always use 'LIKE' and '%'.
    - When asked about schools, check School_1, School_2, and School_3 columns.
    - Use 'LIKE' for smc_school_abbreviation: 'SEBA', 'SOLA', 'SOS', 'KSOE'.
    - When asked about fields of study, search FieldofStudy_1, FieldofStudy_2, and FieldofStudy_3 columns.
    - The "experience" column contains data formatted as a list.
    - The "employers" column contains company names of past employers in a list.
    - "is" in the input from the user has the same meaning as "are"
    - It is important that there is a distiction between past and present tense on the verbs used
    - When asked about a particual department find that name in the JSON Data and use the corresponding key to that value and use that key to look up that department 
     for example when asked about "business" department look at "ORB","BUSAD" and BSAN
    - In the "example queries" below handle "X","Y" and "Z" as a placeholder for a variable
    - These are the values under smc_school: SEBA, KSOE, SOS, SOLA
    - If asked for a degree use the abbreviation of that degree as the search term


    DON'T CHECK FOR DEGREE columns EVER
